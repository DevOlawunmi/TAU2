so we know that the rate is $15 an hour
and we'll go ahead and say that the max hours they can work is 40
Next, I went ahead and got the unknown variables:

*****Important things to know about a while loop
Itâ€™s controlled by a condition and will continue to run while that condition remains true.
The condition is tested before the loop is entered, so there's a chance that this loop will never execute.
It's good to use the While loop when you may or may not need to run the loop, based on the state of the condition.
That's why it's very important to make sure you use your sentinel.
So whatever variable you're using within your condition that controls this loop, make sure that it's getting updated inside of the loop.
